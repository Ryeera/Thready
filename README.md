# Thready
Thready is a Discord-Bot which can be used to automatically create Threads in configured channels for certain types of messages!

Do you know this problem? You created a channel for people to post their artwork or memes in and every time someone posts something, it is immediately pushed out of frame by all the messages discussing whatever was posted? Have you tried using a forum-channel instead just to notice that the memes are no smol images on the side of each post?

**Fear not!**

Thready will fix your issues! With a very simple one-time config, you will enable it in any channel you want for any type of message you want and all these problems will be of the past!

## Invite
You can invite Thready to your server with the minimal set of permissions required using this link: [INVITE](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=918245386441863218&permissions=120259085312&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

## Setup
Simply go to any channel you want to enable Thready in and use the command `/config`. It will open the configuration-dialogue and allow you to setup Thready however you see fit. Don't forget to click on "Enable Thready in this Channel" once you're done!

## Commands
Thready uses the latest Discord-tech for user-interaction. Therefore, all commands are slash-commands. There are currently these commands to choose from:

`/config` - Opens a config-dialogue which lets you set up Thready or change the settings for the channel it was executed in.

`/stats` - Currently non-functional, but will provide stats about Thready in the future.

## FAQ
**Where can I get support for Thready or suggest features?**
The easiest way is by clicking on "Issues" up top and create GitHub-issue. If you want to be kept up-to-date about Thready and my other bots, you can also join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ffrArfErfH)!

**Why does Thready not work in some channels?**
Thready needs to be able to see the channels for which it should create threads. Make sure it has permission to see them!

**What data does Thready store about me or my server?**
Thready only stores channel-IDs in order to save what config is used for which channel.

**Can I have my data deleted?**
Of course! Open a new Data Deletion Request by clicking on "Issues" up top! We will try to get to it as quickly as possible and all your data will be deleted completely.
